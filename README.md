*This is a bundle for [NodeCG](https://nodecg.com/); if you do not understand what that is, we advise you read their website first for more information.*

This is a [NodeCG](https://nodecg.com) v1 bundle. You will need to have NodeCG v1 installed to run it. It also requires you to install the [nodecg-speedcontrol](https://github.com/speedcontrol/nodecg-speedcontrol) bundle.

## Usage

### Stream Deck Plugin

Included with this bundle is a plugin for the Elgato Stream Deck software that can be used by various crew members during events. Once you have the Stream Deck software installed, you can install the plugin by running the file `com.esamarathon.streamdeck.streamDeckPlugin` in the `streamdeck-plugin/Release` directory. Currently, you need to set the actions up yourself in the software, so it can easily be customised on the fly.

### RabbitMQ

This bundle integrates with our RabbitMQ server; the settings for this need to be set in the bundle's config.
